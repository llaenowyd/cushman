# cushman toolkit

_Sugarbush Cushman lived by the Ruud pond  
Way up north in Barre Vermont  
Way up high where the maple trees grow,  
She says "I'm from Vermont and I loves the snow."  
In her floppy french cap, seated beneath the maple tree,  
Drinking down the sap, not a care in the world  
Cause it's all in her hands as she throws her head back.  
Married by the minister, her mother made the cake,  
And her husband played the drums in a big dance band,  
And they could take the six dollars they made everynight  
And keep them in hot food in her cast iron pan._
